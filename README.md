# Design Document

Here’s a detailed **System Design Document** and **Setup Documentation** for your ChatApp backend and frontend based on the given folder structure:

# **System Design Document**

## **1. Overview**

**ChatApp** is a messaging application that allows users to communicate in real-time. The system consists of a frontend (built using React and Vite) and a backend (Node.js and Express.js) that handle the core functionalities like messaging, user registration, and login. This document outlines the system architecture, components, and setup instructions.

## **2. Architecture Design**

The architecture of ChatApp is split into two main components:

1. **Frontend (React + Vite)**: Handles the user interface and interactions.
2. **Backend (Node.js + Express.js)**: Manages the server-side logic, APIs, and real-time messaging.

### **System Diagram**

```
+------------+          +----------------+          +------------+    
|  Frontend  | <------> |     Backend     | <------> |  Database  | 
|  (React)   |          |   (Node.js)     |          | (MongoDB)  |
+------------+          +----------------+          +------------+
```

### **Components**

1. **Frontend (React + Vite)**:
   - **Components**: `ChatBar`, `ChatBody`, `ChatFooter`, etc., handle the chat interface.
   - **Vite**: Used as a development server for fast module loading.

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express.js)**:
   - **API Endpoints**: 
     - `/api/messages`: Fetch and post messages.
     - `/api/users`: Register and authenticate users.
   - **Real-time Communication**: Optionally, use **Socket.io** for real-time message delivery.

3. **Database (MongoDB)**:
   - Stores user information, messages, and other application data.
   - Used in combination with **Mongoose** for schema modeling (optional, based on your backend setup).

## **3. Key Components Explanation**

- **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It was chosen for its component-based architecture, ease of development, and efficient UI updates.
  
- **Vite**: Vite is a modern build tool that offers faster and optimized development. It was chosen to improve developer experience with near-instant hot module replacement (HMR).

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that executes server-side code. It was chosen because it allows the use of a single language (JavaScript) across both frontend and backend, simplifying the stack.

- **Express.js**: A lightweight web framework for Node.js used to build REST APIs quickly and efficiently.

- **Socket.io** (Optional): A library for adding real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers. Useful for handling real-time messaging in the ChatApp.

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that allows for flexibility in storing structured and unstructured data. It’s well-suited for chat applications where the schema can evolve.

# **Setup and Run Documentation**

## **Frontend (React + Vite)**

### 1. **Dependencies**

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for front-end development.
- **Other Libraries**:
  - **axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
  - **react-router-dom**: For handling client-side routing.

### 2. **Setup Instructions**

#### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

#### Steps to Set Up:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanjay-gangwar4410/ChatApp.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd client/FE
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build for Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### 3. **Why These Technologies Were Chosen:**
- **React**: Ideal for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Provides a faster and smoother development experience, especially with hot module replacement (HMR).
- **Axios**: A simple promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.

## **Backend (Node.js + Express.js)**

### 1. **Dependencies**

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Framework to build REST APIs.
- **Socket.io** (Optional): To handle real-time bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
- **MongoDB**: (Optional) NoSQL database to store user information, messages, etc.
- **dotenv**: For environment variable management.

### 2. **Setup Instructions**

#### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **npm**
- **MongoDB** (if using a database)

#### Steps to Set Up:
1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create an `.env` File** (if needed):
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   Add the following content:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_db_uri>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
   ```

4. **Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   The server will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. **Why These Technologies Were Chosen:**
- **Node.js**: Enables the use of JavaScript for both frontend and backend, creating a unified codebase.
- **Express.js**: A minimalistic framework for building REST APIs efficiently.
- **Socket.io** (Optional): Enables real-time messaging for the chat application, allowing for real-time updates without constant polling.
- **MongoDB** (Optional): A flexible NoSQL database ideal for dynamic schema changes and storing unstructured data such as chat messages.

## **Running the Application**

Once both the frontend and backend are set up, the application can be run in the following manner:

1. **Start the Backend Server**:
   Navigate to the `server/` directory and run:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   In a separate terminal, navigate to the `client/FE/` directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   

### **Integration**
- The frontend makes API calls to the backend using Axios or the `fetch` API.
- (Optional) If real-time messaging is enabled, the frontend will connect to the backend using **Socket.io** for instant communication between clients.

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Authentication**: Add JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
- **Database Integration**: Add MongoDB for persistent data storage.
